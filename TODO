Todo:
  ✔ Find a way to overlay the elements without modifying existing elements on the dom.  Create new elements and position them so not to affect anybodys site @done(18-05-23 21:56)
  ✔ Fix the elements that have overlays but are not truly clickable- things like aria-hidden and 1px width and height elements @done(18-05-25 20:33)
    This is going to be ongoing...
  ✔ Fix positioning of absolute positioned overlay.  Doesn't seem to work with scrolling @done(18-05-27 21:49)
  ✔ When entering numbers like alt 24 it comes up with a weird up arrow etc.  Find a way to stop it from doing that or change the shortcuts @done(18-06-03 19:39)
  ✔ Add an overlay in to display the current keys pressed - will be useful later when we allow people to backspace and delete a pushed character @done(18-06-05 22:08)
  ☐ For some reason on AOL mail the extenison isn't working.  It seems to be disabling the onkeydown event trigger - onkeyup works though.  Not sure why.

  ☐ Write some logic to account for parent overflows, more info here: (Line 75 = isVisible(el))
  ☐ Add Backspace functionality to delete pushed numbers
  ☐ Make it a bit more user friendly by displaying the pushed numbers on the screen which allow user to fully utilise the backspace functionality
  ☐ Make the following available and fully functional on the overlay
    ☐ Buttons
    ☐ Links
    ☐ Inputs
    ☐ Dropdowns
    ☐ etc
  ☐ Fix extension display on this site: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business/market-data
  ☐ Focus on first input is focusing on a hidden element on this page: https://www.bbc.co.uk/weather
  ☐ Potentially order the overlay link from top to bottom (using the top property on the element)
  ☐ If a user resizes the browser with alt held we should force the overlay to disable
  ☐ Add settings to enable/disable the overlay/find first input
  ☐ Add Exclusion list
  ☐ Add Donate button and setting to show/never show again
  ☐ Test the extension
