Todo:
  ✔ Find a way to overlay the elements without modifying existing elements on the dom.  Create new elements and position them so not to affect anybodys site @done(18-05-23 21:56)
  ✔ Fix the elements that have overlays but are not truly clickable- things like aria-hidden and 1px width and height elements @done(18-05-25 20:33)
    This is going to be ongoing...
  ☐ Fix positioning of absolute positioned overlay.  Doesn't seem to work with scrolling
  ☐ When entering numbers like alt 24 it comes up with a weird up arrow etc.  Find a way to stop it from doing that or change the shortcuts
  ☐ Add Backspace functionality to delete pushed numbers
  ☐ Make it a bit more user friendly by displaying the pushed numbers on the screen which allow user to fully utilise the backspace functionality
  ☐ Make the following available and fully functional on the overlay
    ☐ Buttons
    ☐ Links
    ☐ Inputs
    ☐ Dropdowns
    ☐ etc
  ☐ Fix extension display on this site: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business/market-data
  ☐ Focus on first input is focusing on a hidden element on this page: https://www.bbc.co.uk/weather
  ☐ Potentially order the overlay link from top to bottom (using the top property on the element)
  ☐ If a user resizes the browser with alt held we should force the overlay to disable
  ☐ Add settings to enable/disable the overlay/find first input
  ☐ Add Exclusion list
  ☐ Add Donate button and setting to show/never show again
  ☐ Test the extension
