- Consider adding functionality that hooks into the same kind of thing as Ctrl + F search and Press Enter (after closing find) does
- Giving the ability to type an element name on the page and it'll highlight the link on the page and navigate that way.  It'll highlight the display name of the link/button and pressing enter will click it
